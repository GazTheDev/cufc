I'd like to  welcome you all to our brand new website. We believe this brand new website will bring CUFC to the next level and hope to keep it for many years. 

Built on the latest stack of tech we want to innovate the football website scene. We see loads of sites in our league use third party sites like Pitchero and Football Club Website. We want to be diffreant and set a trend. Gareth will release a post in the future detailing the stack. We are the ONLY football website in the UK built from REACT and GatsbyJS. Something which we are very proud of. 

The new system allows the possibilties to be endless.
